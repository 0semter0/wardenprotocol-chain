# Demand

---EDIT---

**Demand Drivers**
The Warden Protocol aims to drive a sustainable equilibrium between supply and demand of WARD. To drive demand of WARD, there will be a number of intrinsic demand drivers built into the protocol:  
-   **Transaction Fees** - All fees generated are distributed across WARD validators and their stakers.
-   **Operator Bonds** - Operators of services must bond WARD, reducing the circulating supply of WARD and enhancing the protocol’s collective security and stability.
-   **Governance** - WARD will be used for community governance initiatives, creating a last need for a meaningful stake in Warden.

**Keychain Operators**
Keychain Operators serve a vital role within the Warden Protocol - a Keychain is an off-chain service that provides key management services to Warden users. The selected Keychain creates and stores the key material locally and publishes the public key information via Warden. Users can then request signatures for various purposes. 

Keychains are required to pay a WARD bond to the Warden Protocol by the Total Value Secured concept. This WARD bond is locked and can only be unbonded after a 6 month notice period.

**Validator Bonds**
To operate a validator on the Warden Protocol, validators will be required to stake WARD.
