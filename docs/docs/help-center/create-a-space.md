# Create a Space

A Space functions as a management hub for a collection of keys, akin to an organization. It enables you to maintain separate Spaces for distinct purposes, such as distinguishing between personal and professional uses.

To initiate the creation of a Space, click on the icon marked with ">>" located to the right of your current active space, which allows you to manage your Spaces.

Following that, click on "+ New." This action prompts your Cosmos wallet to execute a transaction that facilitates the creation of your new Space.

After the blockchain confirms the transaction, your newly established Space will be available for use.
