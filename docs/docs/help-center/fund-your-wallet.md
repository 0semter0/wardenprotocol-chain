# Fund your wallet

To start using your SpaceWard wallet, you need to fund it with **testnet assets** – for example, **Sepolia ETH**.

:::warning
You should use only testnet assets. Otherwise, you might lose your assets.
:::

To fund your wallet, do this:

1. Connect to [SpaceWard](https://spaceward.buenavista.wardenprotocol.org). If it's your first time, see the [Quick start guide](quick-start).
2. In the left menu, navigate to **Keys**.
3. Select the preferred key (wallet), click **Receive**, and copy the address.
4. Get some Sepolia ETH to your address. You can use these faucets:
    - 👉 [Alchemy Sepolia faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia): Create an account to access the faucet.
    - 👉 [Sepolia PoW Faucet](https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/): Wait until you have 0.05 SepETH to claim your reward.
