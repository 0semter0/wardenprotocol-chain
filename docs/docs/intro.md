# Introduction

Welcome to the Documentation Site for the Warden Protocol!

The Warden Protocol is a modular L1 blockchain for omnichain applications, “OApps”. Our mission is to empower developers to simply launch secure OApps by giving them modular infrastructure for security, interoperability and chain abstraction.

While our documentation site is a work in progress, it will become a comprehensive resource for navigating and building with ease on Warden.

Within these docs, we have simple ELI5s, FAQs, complete with step-by-step tutorials for users, developers, and network participants (such as validators and keychain operators). Regardless of if you're a developer aiming to incorporate the Warden Protocol into your projects, or a user eager to delve into the capabilities of Warden, our documentation will equip you with the necessary tools and information.
