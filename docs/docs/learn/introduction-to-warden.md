# Introduction to Warden

---EDIT---

Contents:

- Start building with Warden Protocol
- Why should I build with Warden Protocol?
- What omnichain contracts can do
- Learn more: an overview of the section and docs in general
- Contribute: a link to GitHub
	- We should migrate the info on how to contribute from the existing docs to GitHub
	- We can also link it from developer guides

**Note 1:** We may need more articles in the Learn section for in-depth explanation of concepts.  
**Note 2:** Probably theoretical info for Validators could also go under Learn. (Check how it's handled in other docs.)
