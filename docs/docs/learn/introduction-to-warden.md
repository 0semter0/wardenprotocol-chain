# Introduction to Warden

---EDIT---

## Warden Protocol

Welcome to the Warden Protocol documentation!

The Warden Protocol is a modular L1 blockchain for [Omnichain Applications](/learn/glossary#omnichain-application) (OApps). Our mission is to empower developers to easily launch secure OApps by giving them infrastructure for [Modular Security](/learn/glossary#modular-security), [Omnichain Interoperability](/learn/glossary#omnichain-interoperability), and [Chain Abstraction](/learn/glossary#chain-abstraction).

You can also participate by operating a [Keychain](/learn/glossary#keychain), running a [node](/learn/glossary#warden-protocol-node), or becoming a [validator](/learn/glossary#validator).

Here is a brief overview of the documentation:

- Learn: The basics: the glossary of terms, protocol modules, whitepaper, etc.
- [Build an OApp](/build-an-oapp/introduction): Guides for OApp developers
- [Build a Keychain](/build-a-keychain/introduction): Guides for Keychain operators
- [Operate a Node](/operate-a-node/introduction): Guides for node operators

## Start building with Warden

Warden Protocol is composed by different components...

Omnichain Applications are a powerful evolution of traditional smart contracts. They allow signing transactions at any chain, while traditional smart contract applications only target users of a single chain. Each OApp consists of three parts:

- An [Omnichain Contract](/learn/glossary#omnichain-contract)
- A [Keychain](/learn/glossary#keychain) or multiple Keychains
- An [Intent Configurator](/learn/glossary#intent-configurator)

To start building an OApp, you need to build a custom Omnichain Contract using CosmWasm. After that, you can build the frontend part with WardenJS.

## Why should I build with Warden?

The Warden Protocol is open to third-party contributions: core protocol development or building [Omnichin Applications](/learn/glossary#omnichain-application) in the Warden ecosystem. We'll reward both types of contributions with builder incentives in [WARD](/learn/glossary#ward-token). More details will be announced soon.
