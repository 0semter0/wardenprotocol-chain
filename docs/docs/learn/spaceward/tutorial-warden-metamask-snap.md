# Tutorial - Warden MetaMask Snap

Now, with the groundbreaking MetaMask Snap feature, you can seamlessly integrate your Test Warden Protocol generated Ethereum addresses directly into MetaMask Flask, ushering in a new era of convenience and accessibility - you will be able to see those addresses tagged “Warden Protocol” in your MetaMask Flask Wallet.

### 1. Requirements

As we are in testnet ensure you have MetaMask Flask installed, the developer-centric version.. Once the final version is released, it will be available through the standard orange MetaMask extension. We will need to be whitelisted to have it in the original MetaMask, pending security audit. 


**Install MetaMask Flask**
To install MetaMask Flask, refer to the official guide: [MetaMask Flask Installation Guide](https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/)

**Important Warnings**
- Deactivate the standard orange MetaMask extension to prevent conflicts with MetaMask Flask.
- Do not store real assets or your current seed phrase on MetaMask Flask. Remember, this is a Developers' Version.

### 2. Integration Steps

1. **Connect to SpaceWard:** Access SpaceWard using any preferred wallet option (Keplr, Leap, Leap Cosmos MetaMask, …).
2. **Follow SpaceWard Tutorial:** Refer to the comprehensive SpaceWard tutorial (Tutorial Link: [Full Tutorial - SpaceWard](https://docs.wardenprotocol.org/learn/spaceward/tutorial-spaceward)) to learn how to:
   - Create a Space
   - Generate a Key
3. **Install MetaMask Snap:**
   - On the right sidebar of SpaceWard, locate the MetaMask logo (the Orange Fox).
   - Click on "Install Snap" and accept the installation prompt when your MetaMask Flask wallet opens.
4. **Navigate to Keys:**
   Access the Keys section from the right sidebar of SpaceWard.
5. **Select a Key:** Choose a Key from the options available on SpaceWard by expanding the respective Key.
6. **Add Key to MetaMask:**
   - After expanding the Key options, click on "Add to MetaMask".
   - Validate the addition in your MetaMask Flask wallet.


### 3. That's it!

Congratulations! You've successfully integrated your SpaceWard Keychains with MetaMask Flask. Now, you can effortlessly connect with your MetaMask Flask wallet on any of your favorite EVM dApps.

**Important Reminder:** Exercise caution and refrain from using real assets at this stage. Safety first!
