More questions about Intents, Spaceward and Modular Key Management with **Warden Protocol**?
Read our FAQ below!

## What are intents?
**Q: What are intents?**
A: Intents are like rules or conditions within a blockchain protocol that determine whether a transaction can proceed. They define the criteria that must be met for a transaction to be considered valid and added to the blockchain.

**Q: How do intents work?**
A: Intents act as predefined conditions that the network checks before approving a transaction: if a transaction meets all the conditions set by the intents, it is approved and added to the blockchain. Otherwise, it is rejected.

**Q: Why are intents important?**
A: Intents ensure that only valid transactions are processed on the blockchain, maintaining its security and integrity. They help establish trust by enforcing the rules that govern the network's operations.

## What is SpaceWard?
**Q: What is SpaceWard?**
A: SpaceWard is the front-end interface for the Warden Protocol, a blockchain protocol designed for multi-chain wallet management and interaction with the web3 space. It provides users with a user-friendly platform to access and manage their wallets, create Spaces (protected environments for wallets), and interact with decentralized applications (dApps) and other components of the web3 ecosystem.

**Q: What can you do with SpaceWard?**
A: With SpaceWard, users can securely manage their multi-chain multi-signature wallets, create Spaces to protect their wallets with intents, and seamlessly interact with various components of the web3 space, including decentralized applications, smart contracts, and other blockchain-based services.

**Q: Why is SpaceWard important?**
A: SpaceWard simplifies the user experience for interacting with blockchain networks and decentralized services. It provides an intuitive interface for managing wallets and accessing the features of the Warden Protocol, making blockchain technology more accessible to a wider audience.

## What is Modular Key Management?
**Q: What is modular key management?**
A: Modular key management refers to a flexible approach to managing cryptographic keys used in blockchain systems. Instead of relying on a single provider for key management, users have the option to choose from a variety of key management solutions, or keychains. These keychains allow users to generate and store their wallet addresses (public keys) securely and sign transactions with their private keys.

**Q: How does modular key management work?**
A: With modular key management, users can select key management solutions that best suit their security and usability preferences. They can distribute the responsibility of key management across multiple keychains, enhancing security and reducing the risk of single points of failure. In the context of the Warden Protocol, modular key management ensures that users have greater control over their cryptographic keys and can choose the most suitable key management solutions for their needs.

**Q: What are the benefits of modular key management?**
A: Modular key management provides users with flexibility, security, and interoperability in managing their cryptographic keys. It allows them to choose from a range of key management solutions, adapt to changing security requirements, and integrate with different blockchain systems and applications. By decentralizing key management, modular key management enhances the resilience and trustworthiness of blockchain networks and ensures that users maintain control over their digital assets.
