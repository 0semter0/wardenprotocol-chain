# Introduction

**Warden Protocol modules** are components built with the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/), which contain most of the Warden Protocol's logic. Users can interact with them by sending transactions or querying [nodes](/learn/glossary#node).

Aticles in this section describe the following modules:

- [`x/intent`](x-intent): It contains the [Intent Engine](/learn/glossary#intent-engine), which executes arbitrary messages uncder certain conditions.
- [`x/warden`](x-warden): It implements Warden's core concepts: [Space](/learn/glossary#space), [Key](/learn/glossary#key), [Keychain](/learn/glossary#keychain), etc.
- *Coming soon: `x/gmp` and other modules.*
