# Manage keys

---EDIT---

## Overview

Keys in SpaceWard are wallet addresses associated with [spaces](manage-spaces). You can create multiple keys in every space you own.

In this section you will find all available [protocol transactions](protocol-transactions) (actions) you can apply to keys with corresponding **WardenJS functions** and **wardend commands**.

## Protocol transactions

### Request a key

You can request adding a new key to a keychain (in a given space).

**wardend command**: `XXX`

```
XXX
```

**WardenJS function**: `newKeyRequest`

```
XXX
```

### Update a key request

You can update an existing key request by writing a result into it. This method is called by a keychain party.

**wardend command**: `XXX`

```
XXX
```

**WardenJS function**: `updateKeyRequest`

```
XXX
```

### Query key requests

To query key requests, use the following:

**wardend command**: `XXX`

```

**WardenJS function**: `keyRequests()` *(?)*

```

### Query a key request by ID

To query a key request by ID, use the following:

**wardend command**: `XXX`

```

```

### Query all keys
