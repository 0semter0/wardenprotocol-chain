# Manage spaces

---EDIT---

## Overview

A space is a management hub for a collection of keys, assets, and intents. You can create multiple spaces for different purposes – for example, to distinguish between personal and professional uses.

In this section you will find all available [protocol transactions](protocol-transactions) (actions) you can apply to spaces with corresponding **WardenJS functions** and **wardend commands**.

## Protocol transactions

### Add a genesis space

To start using SpaceWard, you need to create your first space, or a genesis space *(?)*.

**Note:** The genesis space is created with an automatically generated key.

*(?) That's what happens in user interface. But it looks like there are also commands for adding genesis accounts and keychains in wardend. How should we describe it?*

**wardend command**: `add-genesis-space` *(?)*

```
XXX
```

**WardenJS function**: `XXX`

```
XXX
```

### Add a space

After creating your first space, you can always add more.

**Note:** Additional spaces don't have keys by default, so you'll have to add keys separately.

**wardend command**: `XXX`

```
XXX
```

**WardenJS function**: `XXX`

```
XXX
```

### Update a space

*(?) What exactly can be updated?*

**wardend command**: `XXX`

```
XXX
```

**WardenJS function**: `XXX`

```
XXX
```

### Delete a space

*(?) Is it possible? I don't see it in the UI.*

To delete a space, use the following:

**wardend command**: `XXX`

```
XXX
```

**WardenJS function**: `XXX`

```
XXX
```

### Query spaces

To query spaces, use the following:

**wardend command**: `XXX`

```
XXX
```

**WardenJS function**: `XXX`

```
