# Manage spaces

---EDIT---

## Overview

A space is a management hub for a collection of [keys](manage-keys), [intents](manage-intents), and assets. You can create multiple spaces for different purposes – for example, to distinguish between personal and professional uses.

In this section you will find all available [protocol transactions](protocol-transactions) (actions) you can apply to spaces with corresponding **WardenJS functions** and **wardend commands**.

## Protocol transactions

### Create a space

*(?) What is genesis space? Is it the very first space a user creates? See the wardend command `add-genesis-space`.*

To start using SpaceWard, you need to create your first space.

**Note:** The first space is created with an automatically generated key.

**wardend command**: `XXX`

```
XXX
```

**WardenJS function**: `newSpace()` *(?)*

```
XXX
```

### Add a space

*(?) Is there a different command for adding a space vs. creating a space?*

After creating your first space, you can always add more.

**Note:** Additional spaces don't have keys by default, so you'll have to add keys separately.

**wardend command**: `XXX`

```
XXX
```

**WardenJS function**:  `newSpace()` *(?)*

```
XXX
```

### Update a space

*(?) What else can be updated?*

You can update a space – for example, change the intents associated with it.

**wardend command**: `XXX`

```
XXX
```

**WardenJS function**: `updateSpace()` *(?)*

```
XXX
```

### Delete a space

*(?) Is it possible? I don't see it in the UI.*

To delete a space, use the following:

**wardend command**: `XXX`

```
XXX
```

**WardenJS function**: `XXX`

```
XXX
```

### Query spaces

To query a list of spaces, use the following:

**wardend command**: `XXX`

```
XXX
```

**WardenJS function**: `spaces()` *(?)*

```
XXX
```

### Query spaces by owner

To query a list of spaces by owner, use the following:

**wardend command**: `XXX`

```
XXX
```

**WardenJS function**: `spacesByOwner` *(?)*

```
XXX
```

### Query a space by ID

To query a spaces by ID, use the following:

**wardend command**: `XXX`

```
XXX
```

**WardenJS function**: `spaceById()` *(?)*

```
XXX
```
