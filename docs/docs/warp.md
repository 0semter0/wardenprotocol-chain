# WARP Token


**WARP** is the dynamic counterpart to WARD, adding liquidity and gamification to the Warden Protocol ecosystem. It fuels engagement and participation through innovative tokenomics.


**Tokenomics**


|Property|Details|
|-|--|
| Token | WARP |
| Initial Total Supply | 250,000,000 WARP |
| Decimals | 6 |


**Distribution**


The distribution of WARP is aiming at giving the community a head start to get a chance to accumulate the future WARD tokens.
During the airdrop period, as tracked via the Warden Airdrop website, there will be a leaderboard tracking accrued airdrop points (we call these “WARP Points”) which can be redeemed for $WARP tokens.

**Where to get WARP**


There are 3 ways to get WARP tokens. Also, the more WARP is accumulated by an address, the bigger the airdrop of WARD will be for this address.


- Available on Base
- Swappable in a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool for USDC.
- Claimable via the Warden Airdrop website, where $WARP tokens can be claimed.




**Phases**
WARP evolves alongside the Warden Protocol, adapting to its milestones and community needs.


The Phases will be split into:


1. LBP Phase: Get early access to WARP and start to accumulate points (WARP) ahead of Warden Protocol Mainnet. The more WARP, the more WARD! Link to access the LBP Phase (starting 30/04/2024): https://app.v2.fjordfoundry.com/pools/0xb1cC5aE9f94032e4Ce168C3A4Bc191b7923e7585
2. Farming Phase: Accumulate WARP through on-chain and off-chain activies, as well as providing liquidity for WARP-USDC LP tokens.
3. Reedeming Phase: Get WARD tokens based on your WARP amount - and join Warden Mainnet.
