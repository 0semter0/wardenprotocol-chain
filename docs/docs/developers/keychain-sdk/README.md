# Keychain SDK

Keychain are custodians of private keys on the Warden Protocol.

By being a permissionless and open protocol, anyone is welcome to be a
Keychain operator.

To facilitate the development of Keychains, we provide a Go SDK that abstracts
the communication with the Warden Protocol nodes.
