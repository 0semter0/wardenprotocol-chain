# Introduction

## Omnichain Applications

**Omnichain Applications** (**OApps**) are a powerful evolution of traditional smart contracts. They allow signing transactions at any chain, while traditional smart contract applications only target users of a single chain. Each OApp consists of three parts:

- An [Omnichain Contract](/learn/glossary#omnichain-contract)
- A [Keychain](/learn/glossary#keychain) or multiple Keychains
- An [Intent Configurator](/learn/glossary#intent-configurator)

An example of an OApp is [SpaceWard](learn/glossary#spaceward) – our application functioning as the front-end interface for Warden.

## How to start building?

The main part of any Omnichain Application is an **Omnichain Contract**: a smart contract that allows signing transactions and messages at any destination chain. For this reason, OApp development starts with building a custom Omnichain Contract with [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com).

To learn more, check our list of [CosmWasm resources](cosmwasm-resources).
