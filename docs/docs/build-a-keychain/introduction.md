# Introduction

Every [Omnichain Application](/learn/glossary#omnichain-application) has at least one Keychain – a custodian that generates and stores [keys](/learn/glossary#key) and signs transactions. Keychains contribute to Warden's [Modular Key Management](/learn/glossary#modular-key-management) and [Modular Security](/learn/glossary#modular-security).

The Warden Protocol allows users or external organizations become Keychain operators. They can onboard their own Keychains and charge fees for [key requests](/learn/glossary#key-request) and [signature requests](/learn/glossary#signature-request). Note that Keychain operators typically use MPC networks to generate keys and signatures.

This section explains how to build a Keychain and operate it.

:::tip
To build a Keychain, you can use the [Keychain SDK](/learn/glossary#keychain-sdk). In the future, we're going to provide off-chain infrastructure to facilitate Keychain deployment.
