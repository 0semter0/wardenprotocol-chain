# Introduction

---EDIT---

Contents:

- An intro to node operations
	- Links to the main key concepts and theory related to this section
	- A link to the API reference
- An overview of the section

**Note 1:** We'll explain validator concepts in the Learn section.  
**Note 2:** Perhaps, we can explain delegation plan right in the Introduction, so we don't need a separate article.
