## Introduction

### Summary

The Fusion Chain Proof of Concept aims to be the successor of the Qredochain and will take on more functionalities from the Qredochain down the road. By implementing the Cosmos SDK, we can take an approach that includes more decentralization, more openess to our community and users and utilizing the tools that come with the Cosmos SDK such as IBC and other standard modules. 

As the first step, this PoC aims to decentalize the watcher capabilities by adding logic to receive and process deposit reports from a new type of oracles. The goal is to have a Zero Knowledge- and Merkle Tree verifier contract that guarantees the authenticity of the reported deposits. To validate the feasibility of this approach, the Labs team will conduct a Proof of Concept that focuses on maintaining such a network in a large-scale manner. In the meantime, we are working with simple watchers that report the changes and will get validity through majority. Alternatives to this approach could be an on-demand ZK verifier where the user needs to invoke the process for proving a deposit is valid. 

There are two major Smart Contract modules integrated in the Fusion Chain: The Ethermint module to enable the large community of EVM developers to build and access services on the Fusion Chain and the CosmWasm module that brings the benefits of Wasm with Smart Contracts implemented in Rust to the Fusion Chain. Apart from the Multi-Language support, the Fusion Chain integrates the capabilities of the Cosmos SDK such as a native QRDO token, IBC functionalities to the Qredochain and other IBC-enabled blockchains or staking and governance.

### Motivation

The Cosmos SDK is a very powerful tool for blockchains for decentralized applications. It runs on Tendermint, like the existing Qredochain, but comes with an application-specific architecture and a lot of already existing modules that could bring great benefit to the Qredo ecosystem. With the support of CosmWasm and Etheremint, the Fusion Chain comes with multi-language support which is attractive for a wider developer community as well as provides the infrastructure to integrate other Qredo products and services like QSign smart contracts. Therefore, the Fusion Chain is of great importance for Qredo products and the QRDO coin.

However, the focus on this PoC is rebuilding the watcher and provide an attractive blockchain for third party developers, as the Fusion Chain will be open-sourced once we have a stable version. In the long term, it is possible to add and transfer logic from the Qredochain to the Fusion Chain, including the QRDO token with extended functionality like native staking and native governance.

### Commercial Use Case

The Fusion Chain will be the new main blockchain of the Qredo ecosystem and much more outwards-facing than the existing Qredochain. We aim to provide Qredo products such as  wallets controlled by MPC computation or QSign logic. Apart from the products we will offer the possibility to develop CosmWasm and Solidty smart contracts which is attractive as it combines the best of both worlds - the EVM and the Cosmos SDK. 

Perspectively, this will put the Fusion Chain in a position to transfer logic and responsibilities from the Qredochain to the Fusion Chain. This could be happening through Interchain Accounts via IBC or with the a transfer of the logic.

The Fusion Chain will also host the flagship version of the QSign smart contract. QSign is a smart contract-based cross-chain interoperability protocol that integrates MPC nodes and lets the user remotely control addresses on supported destination chains.

## Technical Overview

The Fusion Chain is built with the Cosmos SDK on top of the Tendermint consensus engine. The Cosmos SDK is an application-specific blockchain enabled by modules. The modules inside the Cosmos SDK consist of sets of standard functionalities dedicated to a specific purpose. There are standard sets of modules for instance the staking module or the governance module which are required if you want to launch a public permissionless Proof of Stake blockchain with the Cosmos SDK. However, it is not mandatory to use any of these modules and you can only integrate what your blockchain or product really needs which makes the blockchain fast, efficient, and less crowded. Any module can be added to a Cosmos SDK chain without adjusting the existing logic of other modules.

In this PoC we are integrating the following three modules: 

1. CosmWasm: CosmWasm is a new smart contracting platform built for the cosmos ecosystem on the premises of WASM to integrate it into their product. Particularly, it is aimed at Go developers with experience with the Cosmos SDK, as well as Rust developers looking for a blockchain platform.
2. Ethermint: Ethermint is an implementation of the EVM, built using the Cosmos SDK. The software enables users to deploy any EVM-compatible code in solidity and immediately enjoy PoS consensus and instant finality with little to no overhead. In this way, Ethermint is a fully integrated part of the Cosmos ecosystem but is also fully compatible with the EVM.
3. IBC: Perspectively, the Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC) will be integrated to the Fusion chain as well. It allows independent blockchains to connect and flourish, transfer tokens and other data, and enrich their ecosystems through every interaction. In Qredo's case we aim to use IBC for exchanging messages between the Qredochain and Fusion Chain as well as Fusion Chain and other IBC-enabled Cosmos SDK chains in the wild.

For reporting deposits of MPC-generated addresses on other L1s, we aim to introduce two types of verifiers that will use Merkle- and Zero Knowledge Proofs to ensure the integrity and constistency of assets from other L1s on the Qredo blockchain ecosystem. Until they are in place, we are running multiple simple watchers that report the deposits to the monitoring module in the Fusion Chain. In Phase 1 of the Fusion Chain, the following architecture applies:

### Solution Architecture

The Fusion Chain allows implementing CosmWasm as well as Solidity smart contracts due to the CosmWasm and Ethermint module, respectively. This allows for a more rapid development process as the creation of new contracts can be submitted right away, whereas having this logic as a module often requires a network upgrade where the majority of the validators need to approve it. 

There are two verifier contracts written in CosmWasm on the Fusion Chain for this PoC. 

1. Merkle Proof Verifier: This contract verifies a provided proof that a transaction was included in a provided block. It receives the proof from an off-chain service that was given transaction information and the Merkle path of the respective transaction. 
2. ZKP Verifier: This contract verifies the actual execution of a provided transaction given the block header and a Zero Knowledge Proof from the ZKP prover that helps verifiying the respective transaction.

These two features combined result in new watcher functionalities that assure a provided transaction is valid and was executed correctly. The results of the new watcher service can either be processed within the Fusion Chain or forwarded to the Qredochain via the IBC protocol. 

In this architecture, we can see that the Fusion Chain is connected with the Qredochain via IBC. The Fusion Chain receives an IBC message from the Qredochain of type "MPC Address" which holds the address of a newly generated address for a user. For newly received addresses, the contract emits events to which the Oracles are subscribed to. The events are their instructions on watching new addresses or terminating watching them. If a new deposit has been detected by the Oracles, they individually submit a `WalletStateChange`transaction to the Monitoring Module on the Fusion Chain. The Monitoring Module receives the transactions and verifies it and stores the data internally in the contract. The blackbird module queries the deposits for each transaction ID or deposit ID and checks whether an associated policy has been met. Is this the case, the blackbird module submits a transaction of type "underlying" which contains information about the confirmed deposit and how to update the entry on the Qredochain. The IBC message gets picked up by the IBC relayer and forwarded to the respective destination on the Qredochain.

This address along with other information submitted by the "MPC Address" message will be stored in the assets module. The assets module, like the monitoring module and blackbird module are implemented as CosmWasm smart contracts.

### Dependencies

1. CosmWasm & Ethermint Module: Have to have this enabled in your Cosmos SDK chain
2. ZK libraries such as Cairo: Cairo is a programming language for writing provable programs, where one party can prove to another that a certain computation was executed correctly

### Security Considerations

[comment]: # (This paragraph should include any security considerations. Especially those that we did not implement in the PoC but need to be implemented once it becomes an actual feature/product of Qredo.)

Creating Zero Knowledge Proofs is a resource intensive calculation that might take a few seconds, depending on how large the input data is. This might result in longer processing time than the block time of a blockchain and could prevent validating transactions on the fly.

Our watcher is a complicated, vulnerable piece of software. Qredo has a single watcher, and it‚Äôs the only link between L1 and L2. An interruption to the watcher breaks this link. It‚Äôs a single point of failure, and a compromise means we can‚Äôt process deposits-& withdrawals anymore. Relayer contract fees are paid for by the wallets in the watcher. The funds are limited, topped-up on demand. Hacking the watcher exposes 10-12 ETH at risk.

## Learnings and Citations

### Learnings

By beginning of 2023, CosmWasm seems to have issues when uploading CosmWasm contracts on ARM devices. When we tried to upload a CosmWasm contract it paniced and we had to switch to x86 machines who were able to successfully upload and run the contract. Once the team of Confio will continue working on CosmWasm, we will report the bug to the project.
