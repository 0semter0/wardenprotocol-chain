# Create a Space

A **Space** functions as a management hub for a collection of keys, akin to an organization. You can maintain separate Spaces for distinct purposes, such as distinguishing between personal and professional uses.

After you connect a wallet for the first time, SpaceWard will prompt you to create your first Space, as shown in the [Quick start guide](buenavista-quick-start).

If you wish to create additional Spaces after that, take these steps:

1. Connect to [SpaceWard](https://spaceward.buenavista.wardenprotocol.org).

2. Navigate to the top-left corner of the page and click **Active Space**.

3. Click **Create New Space**.

4. Approve the transaction for creating a new Space in your wallet.
