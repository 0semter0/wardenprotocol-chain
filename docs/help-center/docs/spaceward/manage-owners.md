# Manage owners

A [Space](create-a-space) can have multiple **owners**, identified by their Warden addresses.

When you create a Space, you become its default owner. You can invite other SpaceWard users to co-own and co-manage your Space. Other Space creators can also add you to their Spaces.

:::tip
You get a Warden address after [connecting your wallet](connect-your-wallet) to SpaceWard. To check your address, click its icon in the top-right corner of the screen.

To add a new owner, take these steps:

2. Navigate to the top-left corner of the screen and click **Owners**.
3. Click **New Owner**.
4. Specify the Warden address and name.
5. Click **Add owner** and approve the transaction in your connected wallet.

**Note**: To remove an owner, just click it, then click **Remove**, and approve in your wallet.
