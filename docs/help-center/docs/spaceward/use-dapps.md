# Use dApps

## Overview

Within SpaceWard, you can access **decentralized applications** (**dApps**) across various blockchains. These applications streamline and centralize your decentralized finance activities for simplicity and convenience. 

There are two ways to access dApps:

- You can connect to any EVM dApp through WalletConnect.
- You can access a SpaceWard-curated collection of dApps.

:::note
As the testnet phase advances, we plan to enhance connectivity with Cosmos chains. Cosmos wallets will gain the ability to interact directly once they are fully integrated with the Warden Protocol. We anticipate to achieve this goal in the months leading up to the mainnet launch.

## Use the SpaceWard collection

To access the **SpaceWard collection** of dApps, take these steps:

1. Connect to [SpaceWard](https://spaceward.buenavista.wardenprotocol.org).
2. In the left menu, navigate to **dApps**.
3. To connect to a dApp, click it and follow the prompts.

## Use WalletConnect

To use **WalletConnect**, take these steps:

1. In the external app you're using, find a section for connecting wallets. Select **WalletConnect**.
2. Copy the pairing code or save the QR code as an image.
3. Connect to [SpaceWard](https://spaceward.buenavista.wardenprotocol.org).
4. Click the WalletConnect logo in the right sidebar.
5. Paste the pairing code or the QR code and click **Connect**.
6. Select the Space or address you wish to use and click **Approve connection**.

## Approve transactions

After you initiate a transaction in a dApp, you'll see an approval request. Then you need to do the following:

1. Click **Approve**.
2. The Warden Protocol will apply a [Rule](manage-rules) to your transaction. This may lead to a signature request in your Cosmos wallet or a different process based on the applied Rule.
3. Your preferred Keychain will sign the transaction and broadcast it to the destination blockchain.
