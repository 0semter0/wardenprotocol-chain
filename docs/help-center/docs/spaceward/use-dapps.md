# Use dApps

## Overview

Within SpaceWard, you can access **decentralized applications** (**dApps**) across various blockchains. These applications streamline and centralize your decentralized finance activities for simplicity and convenience.

This guide explains how to access a **SpaceWard-curated collection** of dApps. Alternatively, you can access dApps by [using WalletConnect](use-external-wallets#use-walletconnect).

:::note
As the testnet phase advances, we plan to enhance connectivity with Cosmos chains. Cosmos wallets will gain the ability to interact directly once they are fully integrated with the Warden Protocol. We anticipate to achieve this goal in the months leading up to the mainnet launch.

## Connect

To access the SpaceWard-curated collection of dApps, take these steps:

1. Connect to [SpaceWard](https://spaceward.buenavista.wardenprotocol.org).
2. In the left menu, navigate to **dApps**.
3. Click a dApp and follow the prompts.

## Approve

After you initiate a transaction in a dApp, you'll see an approval request. Then you need to do the following:

1. Click **Approve**.
2. The Warden Protocol will apply a [Rule](manage-rules) to your transaction. This may lead to a signature request in your Cosmos wallet or a different process based on the applied Rule.
3. Your preferred Keychain will sign the transaction and broadcast it to the destination blockchain.
