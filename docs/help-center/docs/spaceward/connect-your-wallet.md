# Connect your wallet

To use SpaceWard, connect your **Cosmos wallet** to your Warden account:

1. If you don't have a wallet, create one. Currently, the following wallets are available:

   - 👉 [Leap](https://leapwallet.io/download) 
   - 👉 [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/download)
   - 👉 [Cosmostation](https://www.cosmostation.io/products/cosmostation_extension) 

1. Open [SpaceWard homepage](https://spaceward.buenavista.wardenprotocol.org) and click **Connect**.
    
2. Select a wallet to connect.
    
3. Your wallet will prompt you to add the Warden Protocol chain.

4. Approve the transaction, and you'll be ready to enter SpaceWard!

After connecting, you'll receive a **Warden address**.

To get it, click your connected wallet icon in the top-right corner of the screen. A pop-up will open where you can see the wallet details and copy the address.
