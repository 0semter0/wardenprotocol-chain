# Participate in governance

## Overview

After [staking](stake-ward) your WARD tokens, you can **participate in governance**, which means voting on new proposals for the Warden protocol.

Your voting power depends on the total amount of staked WARD. The more you stake, the stronger is your voice!

## Vote

To cast a vote, take these steps:

1. Connect to [SpaceWard](https://spaceward.buenavista.wardenprotocol.org).
2. In the left menu, navigate to **Governance**. You'll see a list of proposals.
4. Click an active proposal you wish to vote on to open its details.
5. Click **Vote** and then select the option you wish to vote for.
6. Approve the transaction in your connected wallet.
